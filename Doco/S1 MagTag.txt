Steps:
- Enter bootloader mode.

	(8/28) 
		- Doesn't work on mac, not found at /dev/cu.usbmodem*
		- On linux On Linux, try ls /dev/ttyS* on some it shows as ttyACM0
			Shows up as:
			ls -l /dev/ttyA*
			crw-rw---- 1 mazerlodge dialout 166, 0 Aug 28 13:04 /dev/ttyACM0

- Install esptool 
	$ pip3 install --update esptool 
		N-- Messages saved to [ESPTool install messages.txt]

- Run ESPTool to check chip ID, verify visible (reference port found above) 
	$ esptool.py --port /dev/ttyACM0 chip_id
		N-- Messages saved to [ESPTool chip_id output.txt]

- You can now upload a binary file with the following command

	esptool.py --port COM88 --after=no_reset write_flash 0x0 firmware.bin
	Don't forget to change the --port name to match, and the file name from firmware.bin to whatever the firmware file name is.

Setup for SpaceX 
	Reference:  https://learn.adafruit.com/spacex-next-launch-display-with-adafruit-magtag

	- Downloaded latest Circuit Python 
		Saved as ~/downloads 
			adafruit-circuitpython-adafruit_magtag_2.9_grayscale-en_US-7.3.2.bin
			adafruit-circuitpython-adafruit_magtag_2.9_grayscale-en_US-7.3.2.uf2

	- Double click reset (medium click pace) to get magtag to show as a drive 

	- Copied uf2 file to MagTag drive

	- Board lights flashed yellow for several seconds then circuitpython drive appeared 

	- Downloaded WiFi test code bundle from:
		https://learn.adafruit.com/spacex-next-launch-display-with-adafruit-magtag/circuitpython-internet-test

		- Extracted to Code/CPy_Native_WiFi_Test 
		- Bup code and lib from MagTag Circuit Py folder to Code/CircuitPyBup 
		- Added secrets.py to .gitignore
		- Updated secrets.py w/ wifi network info and timezone 
		- Copied files to MagTag 
		- Installed screen
			$ sudo apt install screen 
		- Connect serial port via 
			$ screen /dev/ttyACM0 115200
			- Output worked, saved to [Output from WiFi Test on MagTag.txt]
			- Note: ctrl-a, k to kill screen (found on internet) 

	- Downloaded SpaceX bundle from: 
		https://learn.adafruit.com/spacex-next-launch-display-with-adafruit-magtag/code

		Extracted Zip to code folder MagTag_SpaceX
		Copied Code, Lib and Font to MagTag
		Restarted via screen session (still open from above) 
			Note: ctrl-a, k to kill screen (found on internet) 

Next: 
	Charging battery for MagTag.
